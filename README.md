# 🍊 Unicorn Mobile (Flutter Edition)

Frontend for the Vehicle Reservation System, featuring the "Nam Som" (Orange Juice) UI theme.

## 🛠 Setup

Since this project uses a generated structure, you need to restore the platform folders first:

1. **Restore Platform Folders:**

    ```bash
    flutter create .
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Run the App:**

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## 🔑 Configuration

The project uses a `.env` file for Supabase credentials. This file is **ignored by git** for security.
Make sure you have a valid `.env` file in the root directory (already created for you locally).
